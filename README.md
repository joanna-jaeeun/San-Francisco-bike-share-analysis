# Strategic Optimization of Bike Supply and Demand

## Project Summary
The aim of this project is to optimize bike supply and demand in San Francisco during commute hours in order to increase overall usage.
The project identifies shortages at start stations and surpluses at end stations, and proposes a redistribution strategy to nearby stations.
By analyzing usage patterns, the project ultimately aims to improve operational efficiency and boost bike usage.

## Data relationship



## Methodology 
- **MySQL** : To create a database, load data into tables, and perform various analyses by joining tables.
- **MySQL connect with Python** : To handle and visualize data in order to gain insights.


## Conclusions
- User perspective: Reduce user inconvenience caused by bike shortages during commute hours and lack of docking space at destination stations. Provide cost-saving incentives to encourage more frequent and economical use.
